Poll: Who were works with mobile on a daily basis?

Who am I and why am I talking about gomobile?
My name is Zak.
I'm an intern at leaf testing languages, frameworks, and tools to build cross-platform
    mobile tools, minimizing the number of new technologies leaf developers have to use.
For the past 3 months, I've been building a blackbox application for Android using React-Native
    and gomobile, with a thin layer of Java in between.

Tools I've been using:
- React-Native
- Gomobile
- AltBeacon Java SDK

What is gomobile?
   "A tool that lets you turn go code into something useful for an ARM device running Android or iOS"
      Note: Will not work on Genymotion without modification
2. What have I used gomobile for?
   Leaf's backend is written in go.
   We had docs with lots of go code, our backend is very experienced in go, and go was easy to
      learn as a (very) junior developer. In order to prototype quickly, I wanted to
      reuse as much go code as possible. Gomobile allowed me to reuse what had been built and
      recorded in the docs.
Why use gomobile?
   Keep writing go code
   Reuse your business logic in your applications
2. What should you know before using gomobile?
Limited accessibility to native components:
   What you can access with gomobile:
   Internet, audio, motion sensors, graphics with OpenGL
   What you can't access with gomobile:
   	GPS, Bluetooth
Problems can be "ungoogleable"
   If you run into a problem, chances are much greater that it's unique to your system and
      will take you writing your own fixes, using hacky solutions, or waiting for an update.

Now that you've decided to use gomobile, you have to make a decision: How do you want to use it?
